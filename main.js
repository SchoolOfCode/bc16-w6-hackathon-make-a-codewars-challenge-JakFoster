//Connect Four (rings): Lord of The Rings Edition//

//One Ring to rule them all, 
//One Ring to find them, 
//One Ring to bring them all,
//and in the darkness bind them

//This challenge is an elvish take on the classic children's game: Connect Four
//Your function will only accept one 7 wide x 6 high grid of nested arrays as an argument
//There are two players: Gimli and Samwise
//If either player connects four rings in a row, they have won the game
//If neither player connects four rings, the game is a draw
//If neither player has connected four rings, and there are empty slots in the grid, the game is unfinished
//Players can win horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

//Players:
//Gimli's rings are denoted by a 'G'
//Sam's rings are denoted by an 'S'
//Empty spaces are denoted by an 'O'

//Example Grid:
//  [
//      ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
//      ['O', 'O', 'S', 'O', 'G', 'O', 'O'],
//      ['O', 'S', 'S', 'O', 'G', 'O', 'O'],
//      ['G', 'S', 'S', 'G', 'S', 'G', 'O'],
//      ['G', 'S', 'G', 'S', 'G', 'S', 'O'],
//      ['S', 'G', 'S', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G']
//  ]

//Function Outputs
//Gimli wins - return 'We dwarves are natural sprinters.'
//Samwise wins - return 'Po-Ta-Toes. Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew.'
//Draw - return 'One does not simply walk into Mordor.'
//Unfinished - return 'You shall not pass!'

//Good luck, and remember: 'Not all those who wander are lost!'
